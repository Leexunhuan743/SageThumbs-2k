# Development Gotchas

Hard-won traps in this codebase. Each one cost real debugging time; none is
obvious from reading the code.

## The menu preview MUST be an owner-drawn item (regression 1.3.2 → 1.3.6)

**Symptom.** The right-click preview (thumbnail + filename + `3000 x 2000 px - 600 KB`)
renders as a ~6 px horizontal strip of squashed image instead of the ~144 x 136 tile.
Reported 2026-07-26 against 1.3.5 ("since the last update the preview is fucked up, the
image is a tall rectangle"). Present in every build from **1.3.2** onward; 1.3.1 and
earlier were correct.

**Root cause.** Not the compositing, not the decode, not a stale GDI handle: those were
all verified healthy (`cargo run --example previewshot` produced a perfect 144 × 136 PNG
throughout). The item is fine; the *menu host* refuses to give it a row.

A **third-party menu skin** draws the popup itself: StartAllBack, whose `StartAllBackX64.dll`
and `DarkMagicX64.dll` are injected into `explorer.exe` to give Windows 11 a
Windows-10-style dark classic context menu. Its measurement pass treats **every bitmap
menu item as an icon**: it takes the bitmap's width but clamps the row to icon height and
clips everything below it. ExplorerPatcher and similar shell skins are the same class of
host. This is *not* Windows: the identical 144 × 136 `MF_BITMAP` item in a plain
non-injected process renders at full size (verified).

**Why the 1.3.2 change looked right and wasn't.** 1.3.2 ("fix menu theming") moved the
tile from owner-draw to `hbmpItem` on the stated premise that *"bitmap items are drawn
natively, so the popup keeps its own dark/light theme"*. The theming half is true. The
premise that the tile survives is false, and nobody re-checked the tile afterwards. The
change was verified against the bug it fixed, not against the feature it moved.

**What was tried, live in Explorer, before concluding** (each one screenshotted; the whole
point is that none of this is deducible from the docs):

| mechanism | result |
| --- | --- |
| `hbmpItem` on an empty `MF_STRING` item (1.3.2–1.3.6) | ~6 px sliver |
| `InsertMenuItemW` with `MIIM_BITMAP \| MIIM_ID` | ~6 px sliver |
| `MF_BITMAP` item, 32-bpp DIB section | ~6 px sliver |
| `MF_BITMAP` item, screen-compatible DDB | ~6 px sliver |
| `MF_BITMAP` item, 24-bpp DDB | ~6 px sliver |
| `hbmpItem = HBMMENU_CALLBACK` | **no** `WM_MEASUREITEM`/`WM_DRAWITEM` is ever delivered |
| `MF_OWNERDRAW`, id **outside** the range `QueryContextMenu` claimed | item present, zero-sized, never measured |
| `MF_OWNERDRAW`, id **inside** the claimed range | **full 144 × 136 tile** |

So the bitmap *format* never mattered, and `HBMMENU_CALLBACK` is a dead end here: the
shell forwards owner-draw messages to `IContextMenu2`/`IContextMenu3` only for items it
recognises as owner-drawn and whose command id it can map back to this handler.

**Rules that follow.**

- The preview item is `MF_OWNERDRAW` with `WM_MEASUREITEM`/`WM_DRAWITEM` handled in
  `contextmenu.rs`. Do not "improve" it into a bitmap item again: `preview_item_is_owner_drawn`
  and the flyout assertion in `tests/context_menu_latency.rs` exist to stop exactly that.
- **Its command id must be inside the range `QueryContextMenu` returns.** An id one past
  the range gets no messages at all, so the item silently measures to nothing. This is the
  single easiest way to "fix" the preview into invisibility.
- The known cost, unchanged since 1.3.1: **one owner-drawn item drops the entire popup
  onto the classic (light) drawing path**, including every other handler's items. That is
  the real trade, and it is why the preview is opt-out: `MenuPreview = 0` inserts no
  owner-drawn item and the menu renders natively. `MenuPreview = 1` (the default, with the
  preview inside the SageThumbs flyout) confines the classic look to our own flyout and
  leaves the main menu themed; `MenuPreview = 2` puts the preview, and therefore the
  classic look, on the main menu.
- **Verify menu changes by looking at a real menu, not at a test.** Every unit test here
  passed while the preview was a sliver, because they assert what we hand to the menu and
  the menu is what mangles it. Drive Explorer, screenshot the popup, look at it.

### Two different symptoms, two different culprits

The earlier open question is now measured, in a process with no skin injected, forced into
dark mode with the `uxtheme` ordinals (`SetPreferredAppMode(2)` + `FlushMenuThemes`) so a
*dark themed* popup could be sampled without touching the reporting machine's shell:

| host | bitmap item (`MF_BITMAP`) | owner-drawn item |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No menu skin, dark theme | **full tile, popup stays dark** | full tile, **popup turns light** |
| StartAllBack skin (`explorer.exe`) | ~6 px sliver | full tile, popup turns light |

So the two complaints have unrelated causes, and it is worth keeping them apart:

- **The sliver is the skin.** Windows sizes bitmap menu items from the bitmap. StartAllBack's
  measurement pass does not.
- **The white popup is Windows.** One owner-drawn item makes USER32 abandon the themed
  drawing path for the *entire* popup, including every other handler's items, and fall back
  to classic system colours. Reproduced with zero skin DLLs in the process: a menu of plain
  text items renders dark, and adding a single owner-drawn item to that same menu turns the
  whole thing light. The v1.3.1-era comment claiming this was right; it was only the *other*
  half of the 1.3.2 rationale that was wrong.

**Therefore the ideal build picks per host**, and this is now evidence-backed rather than
inferred: bitmap item when no menu skin is injected (tile **and** a dark themed popup, which
is better than any version has ever shipped), owner-draw when one is. Detection would be an
in-process `GetModuleHandleW` for `StartAllBackX64.dll`, `DarkMagicX64.dll`, ExplorerPatcher's
`ep_*.dll` and equivalents.

**The catch, before anyone builds it:** that detection is a name list, and a name list fails
silently in the wrong direction. A skin we have not heard of reads as "no skin", we insert a
bitmap item, and the user is back to the sliver with nothing in the logs. Whoever implements
this should decide deliberately how to handle the unknown-skin case rather than inherit this
paragraph's assumption.

Practical traps hit while splitting a monolith file into a directory module (the pattern
used for `settings_dlg/` and `preview/`, see §4) and while diagnosing preview-pane rendering.
Read this before doing either again.

**Splitting a file into `mod.rs` + siblings ("parent-hub" import model):**

- Import shape: each sibling file does `use super::*`; the parent `mod.rs` does a **private**
  `use child::*` re-import for each child (NOT `pub use`: a `pub use` of items that aren't
  themselves `pub` enough trips an "doesn't reexport anything public enough" lint). This avoids
  the `use super::*` glob-reexport `E0603` ("item is private") tangle that a naive split falls
  into.
- **The `pub(super)` widening trap:** when extracting a leaf module, everything it needs from
  the parent has to be widened to at least `pub(super)`. A blanket "widen anything the compiler
  complains about" pass reliably **misses two categories**: (1) statics/consts/thread_locals
  declared *inside a macro invocation* (the macro expansion hides them from a simple visibility
  grep), and (2) **struct fields** (a struct can be `pub(super)` while its individual fields are
  still private, and the compiler error for that is easy to skim past). Check both explicitly,
  don't assume "the struct is visible" means "the fields are too."
- **`include_bytes!` path breakage:** paths in `include_bytes!`/`include_str!` are relative to
  the *source file*, not the crate root. Moving a file one level deeper into a new subdirectory
  (e.g. `foo.rs` → `foo/bar.rs`) silently breaks any `include_bytes!("../asset.bin")`-style path
  in it; add the extra `../` the new depth requires. This fails at compile time with a missing-
  file error, but it's easy to miss in a large diff.
- **The const-shadowing-a-glob trap:** a local `const` in the original file that happened to
  shadow a name from a `windows::*` (or other) glob import stops being unambiguous once that
  file is split and the const gets re-exported through the parent-hub `use child::*`. The name
  now resolves to two candidates and becomes an ambiguity error at the *use site*, not at the
  definition site, which makes it confusing to trace. Keep any such shadowing workaround const
  in the core/parent file rather than moving it out to an extracted leaf.
- Verify a pure-move split by: a clean build (0 warnings), `cargo fix` to prune now-unused
  imports, the test suite, and a headless `--shot` capture compared byte-for-byte against a
  pre-split capture (identical bytes prove no behavior changed, not just "it compiles").
- Do this kind of refactor as one linear pass of deterministic edits, not as multiple
  concurrent automated edits to the same files: two independent editors racing on one crate's
  imports produces interleaved, half-applied edits that are hard to untangle.

**Reading rendered preview-pane pixels:**

- **ClearType subpixel fringing looks like syntax-highlight color and isn't.** Gray anti-aliased
  text rendered with ClearType shows faint orange/blue fringing at the subpixel level. A naive
  pixel sampler picking up that fringing can misread it as a syntax-highlight color and wrongly
  conclude a plain-text file is being colorized. Before trusting a pixel-sampled color as
  "highlighting," confirm the file's detected language/highlight mode independently (a `Plain`-
  classified file has no highlighter running at all, whatever a color sampler reports).

**Testing the full-screen screenshot editor with Windows UI automation:**

- **`WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` makes the editor undiscoverable.** The Windows automation bridge first
  requires a visible, uncloaked top-level window, then rejects `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`; an ownerless
  window is otherwise accepted. The main capture editor therefore uses
  `WS_EX_TOPMOST | WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`, with its existing explicit foreground activation when
  launched. `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` keeps the popup out of the taskbar by default without hiding it
  from automation. Do not apply this rule to the separate white-flash window: that click-through
  helper should remain a tool window.
- **Automated UI tests must use the exact hidden `--screenshot-automation` route.** It creates
  the class `SageThumbs2KShotAutomation` with a title beginning
  `SageThumbs 2K Screenshot Automation`, covering the complete virtual desktop with an opaque,
  synthetic canvas. It must never copy pixels from the live desktop. Keep it isolated from the
  normal `--screenshot` route and make both classes participate in the one-overlay-at-a-time
  guard.
- **The synthetic route is a privacy and side-effect boundary, not a demo switch.** Clipboard
  writes (including eyedropper hex), save/save-as, uploads/network access, persisted custom
  colours, and native colour/font dialogs must remain disabled there. Its optional test-only
  controls may expose deterministic state through the window title, but must not alter normal
  capture behavior.
- **The toolbar is owner-drawn, so automation has no semantic child buttons to query.** Drive the
  synthetic editor with its keyboard shortcuts and client coordinates after selecting exactly
  one matching class/title/process. Run the window-contract smoke test explicitly with
  `cargo test --test screenshot_automation -- --ignored --test-threads=1`; it is ignored during
  ordinary test runs because it intentionally opens an opaque topmost window over the virtual
  desktop.
